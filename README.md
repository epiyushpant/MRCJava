You will:
- Access all course materials from this repository
- Work on tasks in your **own branch**

## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention

Each student must create and use **only one personal branch** using the following format:

✅ **Examples:**

## 🪜 Steps to Follow

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/epiyushpant/MRC2025OOP.git
```

### 2. Create Your Branch (if not already created)

# Example:
git checkout -b sabina

```
### 3. Work on Your Task
Organize your work inside your personal folder. Suggested structure:

/sabina/
    ├── assignment1/
    ├── lab2/
    └── project/


### 4. Get Latest Changes from `main` Branch

```bash
git checkout main  
git pull  
git checkout your_branch  
git merge main  
:wq   # (If a merge editor opens, this saves and quits) 
```


5. First Time Push COnfiguration 
```bash
git checkout -b yourbranchname
git config --global user.email "your email"

git push --set upstream origin yourbranchname

```
