## 🪜 Steps to Follow

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/epiyushpant/MRC2025OOP.git

### 2. Create Your Branch (if not already created)

### 3. Work on Your Task
Organize your work inside your personal folder. Suggested structure:

/sabina/
    ├── assignment1/
    ├── lab2/
    └── project/
    
### 4. Get Latest Changes from `main` Branch

```bash
git checkout main  
git pull  
git checkout your_branch  
git merge main  
:wq   # (If a merge editor opens, this saves and quits) 
```

5. Stage, Commit, and Push
```bash
git add .  
git commit -m "Completed assignment 1"  
git push origin yourname-rollnumber
```
